      	<p>Citi Bikes are proliferating, and tend to arrive at their Manhattan destinations faster than cabs. A trip of up to half a mile in the city takes, on average, five minutes and 37 seconds by cab but just four minutes on a Citi Bike. That makes riding a bike about 30% faster. The same goes for longer rides. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>But how well is this bike sharing system serving New Yorkers? This website will introduce the situation to you the Citi Bike network from an economic and racial equity perspective, using spatial analysis to investigate the extent to which bike sharing helps to improve mobility options for New Yorkers most in need of such options.</p>

      	<p>A trip between 1.5 and 2 miles in Midtown takes just more than 21 minutes in a taxi and 14 minutes, 30 seconds on a Citi Bike. In the past five </p>
        <p>In the past five years the totals for both Brooklyn and Manhattan have grown enough to stand alone, but totals for the Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island still remain close to the margin of error.</p>
      	<br><br>
        <p>We are asking the following question:</p>
        <p>1. Who has access to Citi Bike, and who doesn’t?</p>
        <p>2.How have the populations with access to Citi Bike changed since 2013?</p>
        <p>3. Which neighborhoods use Citi Bike, and which don’t?</p>
        <p>4. How should bike sharing expand in the future to address existing inequities and gaps in the transit system?</p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p id="text1">We did an analysis based on a spatial analysis of Citi Bike stations and subway stations in relation to the demographics of New York City. The study’s three key research tasks are 1) to compare the demographics of areas of New York City with bike sharing access to the demographics of areas without such access, 2) to identify demographic differences in actual bike share ridership, and 3) to identify areas of the city which would be plausible candidates for bike sharing, if questions of social equity were prioritized in the development of future bike sharing services.</p>

        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p>The New York city council speaker, Corey Johnson, who introduced the “streets master plan” bill and is anticipated to run for mayor in 2021, said after the vote: “The way we plan our streets now makes no sense and New Yorkers pay the price every day, stuck on slow buses or risking their own safety cycling without protected bike lanes … I want to completely revolutionise how we share our street space, and that’s what this bill does. “</p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p>“This is a roadmap to breaking the car culture in a thoughtful, comprehensive way, and I am so proud to pass this bill today." </p>

     	<br><br>
     	<p>Process </p>
     	<br><br>
     	<p>First of all, identify the neighborhoods that belong to the low-come ones. </p>
     	<br><br>
     	<p id="text2">We plan to use American Community Survey (ACS) data source. </p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p>ACS has tables of income and demographical data in each community, helping to get income per capita for each community in the New York City.  </p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p>Then making the choropleth map indicating the low-income and middle-income neighborhoods. </p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
     	<p>Fig1 illustrates which neighborhoods belong to the low-income and middle-income neighborhoods, as well as the neighborhoods that exclude from the analysis. </p>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        <p>The low-income neighborhoods cluster together and appear in four of the five NYC counties.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>Next, identify the neighborhoods that belong to the low transport accessibility ones. We plan to overlap three public transport layers(in dots) and their service buffers(in areas).</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>A) Bike sharing docks </p>

           <br><br>
            <p> D) and service buffers for each transport. </p>
           <br><br>
           <br><br>
            <p>We plan to get the size and location of bike sharing docks/ bus routes stops/ subway stations in the New York City, then generate different levels of buffers for each dock/stops/station according to their sizes. </p>
